1.How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Creating user stories helps you understand what users need by putting their goals and problems into clear, simple language, which makes it easier to design and build the right features in your program.

2.How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by focusing on understanding user needs first, then building solutions in small, testable steps; in the future, I hope to incorporate Agile processes like creating user stories, working in sprints, and holding regular reviews to make sure the program stays aligned with what users actually want.

3.What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means communicating openly, supporting others, staying flexible when things change, and always focusing on building the best solution together not just finishing your own tasks.
